# Lineman Bootstrap Overrides

A simple vanilla [Lineman](http://linemanjs.com) setup that includes [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) along with the `.less` and `.js` files that Lineman is setup to compile.

This repo has a simple scheme where a single manifest.less file controls the output of the compiled .css bundle.

Any new files can be imported within `app/css/manifest.less`
